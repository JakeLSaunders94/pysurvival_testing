    "# Predictive Maintenance Analysis in Python using Pysurvival\n",
    "This is the predictive maintenance tutorial from the pysurvival docs, which can be found\n",
    "[here](https://square.github.io/pysurvival/tutorials/maintenance.html).\n",
    "General idea is so that I can learn some core machine learning concepts alongside pysurvival.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is survival analysis?\n",
    "Put simply, survival analysis is using historical data to predict the probability of an event\n",
    "happening at any given moment. Good examples of this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Banks, lenders and other financial institutions use it to compute the speed of repayment of\n",
    "loans or when a borrower will default.\n",
    "- Businesses adopt it to calculate their customers LTV (lifetime value) or when a client will churn.\n",
    "- Companies use it to predict when employees will decide to leave.\n",
    "- Engineers/manufacturers apply it to predict when a machine will break.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, I might have used regression as part of six sigma based approach to predict something\n",
    " like mean time to failure and the preceding factors.\n",
    "However, this ignores the data we have for assets that have not failed in our dataset's timeframe,\n",
    " which is just as important as the ones that have.\n",
    "This is called censoring. Survival models account for this censoring and incorporate the\n",
    "uncertainty into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What does this have to do with predictive maintenance?\n",
    "Well, what if you're running a load of engines all around the world and you're measuring a bunch\n",
    "of data from those engines. If you knew that an idling\n",
    "engine RPM of 1250 or more for longer than 5 minutes when the atmospheric temp is above 30 degrees\n",
    "and coolant temp was above 95 degrees meant that your\n",
    "radiator was statistically about to break, that would be valuable information. Survival models\n",
    "should be able to tell us this based on historical data."
